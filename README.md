IceCube is a 1 cubic kilometer neutrino detector array embedded deep within the ice sheet at the South Pole. The experiment involves several scientific disciplines and is centered around the classification, detection, and analysis of astrophysical neutrino events. On average, several hundreds of astrophysical neutrino events per year are detected and of significant interest to the scientific community. One of the questions IceCube seeks to answer is whether there are constant or intermittent sources of neutrino emission we can identify from these interesting events. The signal events must be separated from the ~100,000/yr background events through statistical analysis to determine if a spot on the sky can be considered a point-source. A full-likelihood analysis which assigns signal and background probabilities to each neutrino event and considers contributions from all those events is commonly used in IceCube point-source analyses. This presentation discusses the full-likelihood method, its use in recreating the discovery of the TXS 0506-056 neutrino point-source, and our groupâ€™s results from testing whether the recently discovered PSO J0309+27 blazar is a potential neutrino point-source candidate.
